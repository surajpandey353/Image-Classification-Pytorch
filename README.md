# Image-Classification-Pytorch

This contains stepwise prcedure to create and train a Convolutional Neural Network with Custom Data sets in Pytorch.
Aroud 3700 images had been taken as Training Data and 160 as Validation. I achieved an accuracy of 96% with this Ntwork Architecture as defined in model.py
